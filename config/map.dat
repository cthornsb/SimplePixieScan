#  - Entries must be delimited with SPACES!
#  - Blank lines and text following a # are ignored
#  - Types, subtypes, and tags are not case-sensitive
#  - Empty channels DO NOT need to be defined here
#  - Ranges of channels may be specified by a string with format "start:stop[e|o]"
#      where "start" and "stop" are integers indicating the start and stop channel
#      respectively and the optional character after the stop channel may be either
#      an "e" for only even channels or an "o" for only odd channels (e.g. "3:14e" 
#      would define the following list of channels [4,6,8,10,12,14])
# Syntax:
#  MOD CHAN TYPE:SUBTYPE:TAG(S)
#0 0 hagrid::start                     # This line is commented and will be ignored
0 0 trigger::start                     # Detector TAG "start" indicates that this is the global start detector
0 1 trigger::start                     # Multiple starts are allowed (e.g. double-sided beta starts etc.)
0 14 logic::untriggered                # Logic signal, does not require coincidence with start detector due to "untriggered" TAG 
1 0:15 genericbar::                    # Generic bar type detectors (e.g. VANDLE) defined for channels 0-15 in module 1
2 0:9 liquidbar::                      # Generic liquid bar type detectors (e.g. SABRE) defined for channels 0-9 in module 2
# Double-sided PSPMT bar definition follows
#  TAG="" denotes the DYNODE, TAG=inter-cardinal direction denotes ANODE (e.g. [se, ne, nw, sw] or [v1, v2, v3, v4])
#  SUBTYPE="left" denotes the LEFT side PSPMT, SUBTYPE="right" denotes the RIGHT side
#  SUBTYPE="" denotes SINGLE-ENDED detector
